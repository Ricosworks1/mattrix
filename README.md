# Mattrix — bdemperor bot 👓🤝

**“Your Vision is Our Mission.”**

Mattrix is a **CRM for conferences** that transforms how professionals connect and manage contacts.  
At its core is **bdemperor bot**, a networking assistant that lets you seamlessly register, organize, and classify new contacts in a **decentralized database powered by Golem**.  

Unlike traditional CRMs, Mattrix ensures **privacy, scalability, and trustlessness**, while also paving the way for **Coinbase mini-app integration** — bringing Web3 utility and mass adoption from day one. 

Looking ahead, our vision extends beyond apps: imagine walking into a conference wearing Ray-Ban smart glasses that automatically recognize attendees, securely pulling up their profiles and contact details in real time — all while preserving privacy through decentralized identity.
